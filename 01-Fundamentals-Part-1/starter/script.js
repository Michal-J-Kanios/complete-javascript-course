//ASSIGNMENTS
//Assignment 1:
//Declare variables called country, continent and population and assign their values according to your own country (population in millions).

const country = "Poland";
const continent = "Europe";
let population = 38500000;

//Assignment 2:
//Declare a variable called isIsland and set its value according to your country. The variable should hold a Boolean value. Also declare a variable language, but don't assign it any value yet.
//Log the types of isIsland, population, country and language to the console.

//Assignment 3:
//Set the value of language to the language spoken where you live (some countries have multiple languages, but just choose one).
//Think about which variables should be const variables (which values will never change, and which might change?). Then, change these variables to const.
//Try to change one of the changed variables now, and observe what happens.

//If your country split in half, and each half would contain half the population, then how many people would live in each half?
//Increase the population of your country by 1 and log the result to the console.
//Finland has a population of 6 million. Does your country have more people than Finland?
//The average population of a country is 33 million people. Does you country have less people than the average country?

//Predict the result of these 5 operations without executing them:
console.log('9' - '5'); // -> 4
console.log('19' - '13' + '17'); // -> 617
console.log('19' - '13' + 17); // -> 23

//Assignment 8:
//If there is only 1 neighbour, log to the console 'Only 1 border!' (use loose equality == for now).
//Use an else-if block to log 'More than 1 border' in case numNeighbours is greater than 1.
//Use an else block to log 'No borders' (this block will be executed when numNeighbours is 0 or any other value).
//Test the code with different values of numNeighbours, including 1 and 0.
//Change == to ===, and test the code again, with the same values of numNeighbours. Notice what happens when there is exactly 1 border! Why is this happening?
//Finally, convert numNeighbours to a number, and watch what happens now when you input 1.
